# Migrate Stack

Migrate code from one technology to another, using context7 to learn both the source and target stacks.

## Frontend migration

Migrate a frontend folder from one framework to another.

### FR

```
Explore the @src/ folder to understand the current Angular codebase, then migrate it to Next.js with React and TailwindCSS. Use context7 to deepen your understanding of both Angular and Next.js, and use the /next-best-practices skill as reference.
```

```

## Backend migration

Migrate a backend folder from one framework/language to another.

### FR

```
Explore the @backend/ folder to understand the current Fastify/Node.js codebase, then migrate it to Rust with Axum and SeaORM. Use context7 to deepen your understanding of both Fastify and the Rust stack (Axum, SeaORM, Tokio).
```

```

## Migration PRD

When the migration is too large for a single session: generate a PRD split into user stories.

### FR

```
Explore the @src/ folder to understand the current codebase, then write a PRD in the @tasks folder with /ralph-tui-prd to migrate from Angular to Next.js with React and TailwindCSS. Use context7 to deepen your understanding of both the source and target stacks.
