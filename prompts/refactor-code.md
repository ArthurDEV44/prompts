# Refactor Code

Refactor existing code to improve structure, readability and maintainability: extract functions, separate responsibilities, apply design patterns, reduce duplication. Unlike optimize-code which focuses on performance, this focuses on code architecture and clean code principles. Uses context7 and relevant skills from the library when applicable to the files being refactored.

## Single file

Refactor a single targeted file.

### FR

```
Explore the file @backend/api/sources.rs, then refactor the code: extract functions, separate responsibilities, reduce duplication, and apply appropriate design patterns. Use context7 to deepen your understanding of the technical stack, and use relevant skills from your library if applicable to the code being refactored.

## Folder

Refactor all files in a folder in one pass.

```
Explore the code in the files from the @backend/api/ folder, then refactor the code: extract functions, separate responsibilities, reduce duplication, and apply appropriate design patterns.
